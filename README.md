> Terraform module for encrypting secrets for Renovate

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) is a tool for automatically updating dependencies in your projects, similar to [GitHub Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot-version-updates). As a native service, Dependabot is given read access to GitHub Actions organization secrets to [access private registries](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#configuration-options-for-private-registries). Terraform can manage these secrets using the [`github_actions_organization_secret`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs/resources/actions_organization_secret) resource. Renovate, as a third party GitHub app, [does not access GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/private-modules/#access-to-github-actions-secrets). Instead, Renovate allows users to [encrypt secrets](https://docs.renovatebot.com/private-modules/#encrypting-secrets) using Renovate's public key and include the encrypted value in the Renovate configuration. Renovate's servers hold the private key and can decrypt the original plaintext value.

This module performs the same public key encryption as [app.renovatebot.com/encrypt](https://app.renovatebot.com/encrypt), enabling secure and fully automated secret management for Renovate, using Terraform.
